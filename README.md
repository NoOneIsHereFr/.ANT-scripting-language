# .ANT File Documentation
## Why?
So I am sitting here on my desk at 11 PM writing my "scripting language".
but why? I just want to test my python skills and also its a lot of fun.

you can find the source file in the main branch soon

## Hello, World!?
So my language has just one suffix thts ".ant".
to create a hello world script you need to type "PRINT(Hello, World!)".
there are no variables (for now) so you just need to type text.
the print command work like this:

```
def PRINT(text):
    print(text)
```
